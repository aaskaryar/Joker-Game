# Title: Jokerâ€™s Game

#General overview of the game and requirements 
Players 2-4
Need one standard deck of cards with one joker in the deck
52 cards + 1 joker card = 53 cards total
Team based game formed in groups of 2 with 2 team members on each team. 

#Hierarchy
2 < 3 < 4 < 5 < 6 < 7 < 8 < 9 < 10 < J < Q < K < Ace < Joker 
Clubs < Spades < Hearts < Diamonds 
Lowest(weakest)----------------------------------Highest(Strongest)

#Objective of the game
The objective of this game is for your team to win the most hands(points) possible. In each round the first team to win 7 hands wins that round giving them 1 point. You can play as many hands as you want, and at the end, the team/individual with the most points wins the game.

#Instructions
Team members must sit across from each other meaning the person on either side of you is on the opposing team and your team member is sitting across from you. This game can also be played by 2 players with no teams. Evenly disperse all the cards out to each player, each person should have 13 cards faced down, while one person has 14 cards in their deck faced down. Once all the cards are divided equally each player picks up 5 cards from their deck. [Tip: once you pick up 5 cards it's a good technique to organize your cards from ascending order 2-10,J,Q,K,A,Joker]. The players must have 5 cards in their hands at all times so after each round each player will pick up one new card from their deck. Now that everyone has 5 cards in their hand, they will take turns placing a card down in a clockwise rotation. Each round starts with the winning team(if it's the first round, picking one player from each team to play rock paper scissors to see who goes first)going first then going in a clockwise rotation till reaching the last person. Each player will put a card down and the objective to win the hand is by playing a larger card than your opponent, but also making sure you are not sabotaging your own teammate. Whoever had the highest card placed down wins that hand. Repeat this process until your team gets 7 hands. After winning a round your team will be awarded 1 point, and can go first next round. The Joker is the wild card meaning it's an instant win for a hand, nothing beats a joker. It can be played whenever the player who has it in their hand wants.
